    <h2 class="text-xl py-2 text-black dark:text-white">Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>Here you will find a bunch of stuff related to my work, projects, ideas, and essays about various subjects.</p>
    <p>As you can probably tell, the layout of this website is quite unconventional. I wanted to design it like a desktop environment, which I thought would be a refreshing break from the standard, boring static websites.</p>
    <p>To navigate through the different pages, you can open new windows using the dock below. You can also make a window fullscreen, minimize it or close it. Additionally, you can move and resize them either by clicking in its corners and header, or by pressing alt and holding anywhere on the window. Use the left mouse button to move and the right mouse button to resize!</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl py-2 pt-3 text-black dark:text-white">A little about me</h2>
    <p>I'm a student from Brazil, currently learning about Computer Science and development in general.</p>
    <p>While I enjoy almost anything tech-related, I have a particular interest low-level development, and like learning about how things really work under the hood. Other than that, I am also a passionate Linux user.</p>
    <p>In my projects, I usually value things like minimalism and streamlining, often by cutting off all unnecessary features, or implementing my ideas in the most efficient manner. This is particularly evident in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mgcvale/opensync-backend" class="text-sky-950 dark:text-sky-300">opensync</a> project, and my arguably excessive use of SQLite. However, I'm willing to sacrifice these ideals for more reliability or ease of development when necessary.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl py-2 pt-3 text-black dark:text-white">A little about this website</h2>
    <p>This website was built primarily using Svelte, Tailwind CSS, SCSS and TypeScript. Other than that, I also used some other resources to facilitate the development, such as some Svelte components from <a target="_blank" class="text-sky-950 dark:text-sky-300" href="https://animation-svelte.vercel.app/">Svelte Aceternity UI</a>, and icons from <a target="_blank" class="text-sky-950 dark:text-sky-300" href="https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-svelte">lucide-svelte</a>. You can check the full code on my <a target="_blank" class="text-sky-950 dark:text-sky-300" href="https://github.com/mgcvale/mgcvale.github.io">Github</a>.</p>
