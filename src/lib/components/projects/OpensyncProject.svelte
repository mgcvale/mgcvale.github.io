    <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Opensync - Lightweight, fast and open-source self-hosted file backup system</h3>
    <p>Out of furstration with Google Photos' shady subscription tactics and limited phone storage, the Opensync project was born. It seeks to transform unused space on home computers into a convenient solution for mobile photo and file storage.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">What Makes It Unique?</h2>
    <p>Today, most file backup systems are subscription-based and hosted on the cloud, with few open-source and self-hosted options available. Furthermore, the open-source solutions that do exist rarely offer automatic integration with phone photos (like Google Photos) while maintaining a streamlined feature set and performant backend.</p>
    <p>Opensync aims to fill this gap, offering a streamlined and performant backend written in C, and a multi-platform frontend with seamless integration and bloat-free interface.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">How is this being done?</h2>
    <h3>The backend</h3>
    <p>In order to this project possible, our first priority was the backend, as one of our main goals was to build something performant and streamlined that could run on any hardware.</p>
    <p>The first obvious choice for the backend C. Since it wouldn't be too complex, scalability wouldn't be a major concern, and using C allowed us to minimize overhead.</p>

    <p class="mt-2">We had two options: use an existing framework, like Mongoose or libmicrohttpd, or handle requests directly with Berkeley Sockets. We chose the latter.</p>
    <p>At first glance, this may seem like a crazy decision, but it allowed us to do some pretty impressive things to optimize the server, such as creating custom protocols and keeping the overhead to an absolute minimum.</p>
    <p>However, we also wanted some level of abstraction. To achieve that, we encapsulated the low-level logic of the server in a pseudo-framework, which we aptly named <a href="https://github.com/mgcvale/sculpt" class="text-sky-700 dark:text-sky-300 hover:underline" target="_blank">Sculpt</a>, managing asynchronous I/O and basic parsing logic.</p>

    <h3>The frontend</h3>
    <p>Unlike the backend, the frontend didnâ€™t need to be as focused on performance and streamlining.</p>
    <p>For that, we choose Svelte. It compiles into pure JS, CSS and HTML, and is known as one of the fastest reactive front-end JS Frameworks.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the stack also includes SCSS and Tailwind for styling.</p>
