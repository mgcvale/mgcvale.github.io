    <h3 class="text-xl">JurAI - Simplifying Legal Processes with AI</h3>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">JurAI is the final project for my Computer Science and Technical Education course at Unicamp. It’s designed to help lawyers manage legal research, client interactions, and case requests using AI tools inspired by real-world legal challenges.</p>
    
    <h2 class="mt-4">What Makes It Unique?</h2>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">When lawyers handle a new case, the most tedious part is researching precedents—sifting through countless cases, statutes, and regulations to identify relevant examples and build strong arguments. Legal databases are vast, and the documents are often lengthy and complex, making this process time-intensive.</p>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">JurAI streamlines this by offering three AI tools to accelerate research and provide valuable insights, saving lawyers time and effort.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg">1. Probability AI</h3>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">Our first tool, Probability AI, analyzes a case summary to estimate the chances of winning, losing, or partially winning the case. This helps lawyers quickly assess the case's viability.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg">2. Argument AI</h3>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">The second AI reviews a case summary or detailed document and generates a list of successful arguments from similar cases. This gives lawyers actionable insights to strengthen their strategy and approach.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg">3. Summary AI</h3>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">Our third tool, Summary AI, extracts and condenses the key information a lawyer needs to understand about a case. It identifies critical details such as relevant statutes, precedent cases, and potential challenges, presenting them in a clear and organized summary.</p>
    <p class="dark:text-neutral-100">This tool mirrors what a lawyer would learn through extensive research, but it delivers the insights quickly and efficiently, allowing more time for strategic planning and client interaction.</p>
